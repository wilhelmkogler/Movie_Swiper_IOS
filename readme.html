<p align="justify">This mobile app named 'KWheels' allows users to browse cars from a custom-built database, using
    various filtering and sorting options. Users have the ability to create an account, log in, and add their favorite
    cars to a personal garage. There is a FAQ section to help answer common questions, and if the user doesn't find what
    they're looking for, they can submit their own question through a contact form. There is also a loan calculator
    available to make it easier to estimate car financing.

<h3>Profile</h3>

<p align="justify">Users can create an account by filling out a registration form, which includes input validation to
    prevent incorrect or irrelevant data from being submitted. If a username or email already exists in the system, the
    user receives a notification. Upon providing valid information, the user's data is stored in the database, and their
    password is securely encrypted. During login, the system verifies the credentials to ensure that the user exists,
    and if the check is successful, grants access to the platform.</p>

<h2>Garage</h2>

<div align="center">

    access later at any time. Cars in the garage can be removed individually by clicking the trash bin icons, or the
    entire garage can be cleared with a single button click.</p>

</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p align="justify">There is a question section as well, containing some Frequently Asked Questions. A custom question
    submission form is also available, where users can ask their own questions. These messages are sent directly to the
    site administrator's email address provided in the backend.

</p>

<h2>Contact & Car Informations</h2>

<p align="justify">The Contact page is where visitors can find a short description of the dealership's address, opening
    hours, and contact details. To make it easier for users to locate the dealership, an integrated Google Map is also
    included on the page. Some key factors of the Dealership's vehicle types also can be very helpful before making the
    right decisions.</p>

<h2>Loan Calculator</h2>

<img src="assets/images/git/11.png" alt="" srcset="">

<p align="justify">This section is to help users better and more quickly understand their financing options. By entering
    just a few detailsâ€”such as the full price of the car, the interest rate, the down payment (either as an amount or a
    percentage), and the loan termâ€”users can instantly calculate their estimated monthly installment. With the click of
    a button, the monthly payment is displayed.</p>
